### Description

BigNum Calculator by Robert Rayment. Does calculations on, up to, 1024 bit numbers (~310 dec &amp; 256 hex digits). Operations on single numbers include shift left/right, roll left/right, Not, Factorial, Squared &amp; Cubed. On two numbers - And, Or, Xor, Eqv, Imp, Div/Mod, Mul, Sub &amp; Add. The full results can be displayed and saved to the clipboard or a file. All calculations are for positive integers only. Make sure to compile the program, particularly for large numbers. Machine code is used for some conversions to speed things up by a few seconds since they take much longer than calculations, principally for 4 digit factorials. For small numbers this has some educational value but very large numbers are just a curiosity, though apparently there is some use in encryption. Zip 27 KB.
